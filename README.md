# Chess_Engine
A neural network for playing chess.

The dataset used to train the neural network can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arevel/chess-games.

The script chessGamePrep.py was used to filter out the data so that only games with high elo players playing with time constraints longer than bullet chess were used to train the neural network.
